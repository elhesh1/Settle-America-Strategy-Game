-----Health lags behind. FIX THAT 


add food items to food page 
    -- make it so some tables only load if page open

population changes

Change number of people addable at a time to an occupation
    -- reset the numbers too

Make a new tab where you can also see health----maybe. 
    -- Something about buildings and houses
    -- add an alert section in the bottom left
